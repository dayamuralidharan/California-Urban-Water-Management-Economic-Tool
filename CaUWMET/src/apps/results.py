                    3) Unallocated SWP/CVP Deliveries: Unallocated CWP/CVP deliveries represent the volume of excess supply that was not stored or delivered due to limited storage capacity or demand for these supplies was lower than the available supply volume entered by the user.  
                    4) Puts to Storage: Puts to storage are determined by each contractorâ€™s storage options, available storage capacity, put capacity, and the amount of excess supply. Average annual puts to storage are summarized in this result field.  
                    5) Water Market Deliveries: Water market deliveries summarize the average annual volume of water that a contractor purchases on the short-term water market.
